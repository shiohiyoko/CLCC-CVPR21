Manually performing all of these modifications would be tedious and prone to error. To streamline the changes, and to make your transition to TF 2.x as seamless as possible, the TensorFlow team has created the `tf_upgrade_v2` utility to help transition legacy code to the new API.\n","\n","Note: `tf_upgrade_v2` is installed automatically for TensorFlow 1.13 and later (including all TF 2.x builds).\n","\n","Typical usage is like this:\n","\n","<pre class=\"devsite-terminal devsite-click-to-copy prettyprint lang-bsh\">\n","tf_upgrade_v2 \\\n","  --intree my_project/ \\\n","  --outtree my_project_v2/ \\\n","  --reportfile report.txt\n","</pre>\n","\n","It will accelerate your upgrade process by converting existing TensorFlow 1.x Python scripts to TensorFlow 2.x.\n","\n","The conversion script automates many mechanical API transformations, though many APIs cannot be automatically migrated.

Those that cannot be automatically upgraded will be mapped to their locations in the `compat.v1` module. This module replaces TF 1.x symbols like `tf.foo` with the equivalent `tf.compat.v1.foo` reference. If you are already using `compat.v1` APIs by importing TF via `import tensorflow.compat.v1 as tf`, the `tf_upgrade_v2` script will attempt to convert these usages to the non-compat APIs where possible. Note that while some `compat.v1` APIs are compatible with TF2.x behaviors, many are not. Therefore, it's recommended to manually proofread replacements and migrate them to new APIs in the `tf.*` namespace instead of `tf.compat.v1` namespace as quickly as possible.\n","\n","Because of TensorFlow 2.x module deprecations (for example, `tf.flags` and `tf.contrib`), some changes can not be worked around by switching to `compat.v1`. Upgrading this code may require using an additional library (for example, [`absl.flags`](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-py)) or switching to a package in [tensorflow/addons](http://www.github.com/tensorflow/addons).\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"s78bbfjkXYb7"},"source":["## Recommended upgrade process\n","\n","The rest of this guide demonstrates how to use the symbol-rewriting script. While the script is easy to use, it is strongly recommended that you use the script as part of the following process: \n","\n","1. **Unit Test**: Ensure that the code you’re upgrading has a unit test suite with reasonable coverage. This is Python code, so the language won’t protect you from many classes of mistakes. Also ensure that any dependency you have has already been upgraded to be compatible with TensorFlow 2.x.\n","\n","1. **Install TensorFlow 1.15**: Upgrade your TensorFlow to the latest TensorFlow 1.x version, at least 1.15. This includes the final TensorFlow 2.0 API in `tf.compat.v2`.\n","\n","1. **Test With 1.15**: Ensure your unit tests pass at this point. You’ll be running them repeatedly as you upgrade so starting from green is important.\n","\n","1. **Run the upgrade script**: Run `tf_upgrade_v2` on your entire source tree, tests included. This will upgrade your code to a format where it only uses symbols available in TensorFlow 2.0. Deprecated symbols will be accessed with `tf.compat.v1`. These will eventually require manual attention, but not immediately.\n","\n","1. **Run the converted tests with TensorFlow 1.15**: Your code should still run fine in TensorFlow 1.15. Run your unit tests again. Any error in your tests here means there’s a bug in the upgrade script. [Please let us know](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues).\n","\n","1. **Check the upgrade report for warnings and errors**: The script writes a report file that explains any conversions you should double-check, or any manual action you need to take. For example: Any remaining instances of contrib will require manual action to remove. Please consult [the RFC for more instructions](https://github.com/tensorflow/community/blob/master/rfcs/20180907-contrib-sunset.md). \n","\n","1. **Install TensorFlow 2.x**: At this point it should be safe to switch to TensorFlow 2.x binaries, even if you are running with legacy behaviors\n","\n","1. **Test with `v1.disable_v2_behavior`**: Re-running your tests with a `v1.disable_v2_behavior()` in the tests' main function should give the same results as running under 1.15.\n","\n","1. **Enable V2 Behavior**: Now that your tests work using the TF2 binaries, you can now begin migrating your code to avoiding `tf.estimator`s and only using supported TF2 behaviors (with no TF2 behavior disabling).
